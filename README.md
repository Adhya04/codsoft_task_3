Hello everyone,

This is a task that was given to me by my authorization hoping that it is understandable and moreover it is correctly done.

The task was to create a rock paper and scissors game using python programming language. In the following task i have used basic funtion operations and nested if-else statement. In this task my program when runs, asks the user the user his choice whuch is between rock, paper, and scissors, then when the user has a choice the random module runs and chooses between the choices as given above. When the computer choice is selected the choices are compared and the the winner of the game is declared and thr program runs again to ask if the user wants to play again.
